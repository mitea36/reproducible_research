#	1. Take an econometric / statistical analysis (e.g. from your bachelor thesis or Kaggle):

    • Translate the codes to a different programming language (e.g. R to Python or Stata to R, etc.)*
    • Reproduce the results.
    • Pick a way to improve the study or update the data** or perform a robustness check and do it.
    • Discuss the findings, potential problems, inconsistencies and conclusions.
*you should try exploiting the advantages and functions of the ‘new’ language *

*data update can include: collecting new survey data (not many), using newer datasets, etc.*

# Take a published (in a peer-reviewed journal) research paper with no code attached. Reproduce its (main) findings. Report on the problems along the way.

#	    3. Take a simple meta-analysis study (examples below). Then do the following:

    • Reproduce the obtained results using the reported sample of studies.
    • Add 2-5 newer studies, preferably using the selection process reported in the original study.
    • Replicate the results with the extended sample.
    • Describe your findings and discuss them.
